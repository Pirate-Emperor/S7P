chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king , featuring an outstanding , oscar - winning performance from kathy bates . geez , french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this ! sorry , non - british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders - my apologies . the pair are british comediennes ( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in \\\" absolutely fabulous \\\" ) , who did a series of film spoofs a few years back , including alien , the exorcist and misery . needless to say , amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates ( the resemblance was quite uncanny ! ) , dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder ' s legs ! but despite the lingering memory of their sketch , and although i ' ve now seen the film a couple of times now , that \\\" hobbling \\\" scene was no less disturbing ! i ' m still left screaming at the telly in revulsion ! that may be the most memorable scene , but it ' s certainly not the only worth watching . stephen king , whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality , strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale . it ' s a nicely crafted psychological horror , which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon ( james caan ) . rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes ( bates ) , who introduces herself as the writer ' s \\\" number one fan \\\" , he soon becomes her prisoner . both the script and kathy bates ' beautifully masterful performance ( for which she won an oscar ) work arm - in - arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit - cake ( or is that fruity as a nut - cake ? ) . bates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece . at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she ' s a rather tragic character , and more often than not she ' s just damned scary ! this is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity . it ' s an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it ' s basically a two - hander , mainly set in one locale , it ' s a remarkable piece of cinema . there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner ' s stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan . oh , i haven ' t really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who ' s a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books ) . but , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show . along with the pig , of course ! anyway , the tension is built - up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense . there ' s the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve - shattering lengths to poison her wine . he succeeds , but . . . she knocks the glass over ! i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well ! in the immortal words of homer j . simpson - \\\" d ' oh ! ! \\\" other nerve - wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house . we cut to annie in her car - she ' s on her way home . . . he realises this and tries to get back to his room . . . cut to the car again , she ' s getting near . . . will he make it ? ok , so these sequences aren ' t exactly original , nor perhaps unpredictable - but they work ! boy , do they work ! if a film has you on the edge of your couch , biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense , then it ' s doing something right ! of course , the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned \\\" hobbling \\\" ! annie realises her captive has been out of his room , and she ' s going to stop him once and for all . cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer , and . . . i feel ill just thinking about it ! nasty . it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand , and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho ! and then we ' re given one of the most ridiculously over - the - top fight scenes i ' ve ever seen . she gets hit over the head with a typewriter , set on fire , head smashed against the wall - and she just won ' t die ! sheldon isn ' t in terribly good shape either . if it weren ' t so gorey it would almost be laughable . but it ' s a terrifically effective film , and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked . misery is a tight , tense , intense and chillingly entertaining thriller . the directing is first - rate , and the performances - bates in particular - contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem . wonderful stuff . ? - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - for more regularly - updated film and tv reviews , check out my site ! http : // www . geocities . com / hollywood / bungalow / 4960 -

somethings during that fateful summer : vinny ( john leguizamo ) , a club - hopping , adultrous hairdresser , his benevolent wife dionna ( mira sorvino , looking young ) , ritchie ( adrian brody ) , a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect , a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters . we follow them through their roller coaster lives , thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings . vinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him , make him stay faithful to her . ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more \\\" eccentric , \\\" and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend . tensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sam ' s first murder looms ; the night he promises he will strike again . a local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects . at the top of the list is ritchie . vinny , an unwilling part of the said group , is called upon to set a trap for his friend . as we watch these proceedings , some of which are painfully graphic , the dreaded \\\" so what ? \\\" question springs to mind . from the way this movie is made , i ' d have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something , but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find . lee touches on so much -- the media , the 70 ' s punk scene , the details of the actual killings , as well as the characters ' very personal dilemmas -- but he doesn ' t bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement . all is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow ; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable . too bad summer of sam doesn ' t get any help here . frankly , it ' s a bore , a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesn ' t entertain beyond its first half hour . there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague . leguizamo ' s turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny . the script makes it clear that we ' re supposed to believe that his character is flawed , but still a good guy . you ' d never guess from his performance . adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better . sorvino gives a riveting , touching performance in a banal movie ( i ' m tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane ) ; her character is affecting and her emotions true - to - heart . brody , too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for . summer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film : it looks great , it has a few notable performances and i suppose it ' s pretty well directed , in a purely technical way . but it ' s also empty , pretentious and boring . like last year ' s the thin red line , it ' s a movie by a director who doesn ' t know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway . ? 1999 eugene novikov &# 137 ;\",\n          \"in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because , in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen - style , earnestly shallow gen - x angst pictures , it seemed to be actually about something . it angered people , started arguments outside the theater , riled things up . it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film . having endured my share of the hype , i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside , and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about . does men live up to its press ? well , yes it does . and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office . for the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment . chad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business . chad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder . howard is chad ' s boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent . we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge . there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her . the reason ? both men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex . \\\" it ' ll restore a little dignity to our lives , \\\" he says . howard , helpless against the force of chad ' s will , agrees to the plan . they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp . chad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner . howard follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham - handed and desperate . flattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both . you can guess which one she falls for . soon a tragic lovers ' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she ' s handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him . adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ? in chad , writer / director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film - hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls . his evil is as subtle as a viper ' s , and as easy as his smile . we watch in stunned disbelief as he back - stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine ' s heart . his character would be a joke if he wasn ' t so chillingly real - all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him . he ' s the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness . if one of his co - workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind . politics is his game , and the modern cubicle - filled office is his playground . men wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory . the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won ' t describe . the scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril . could it happen in the real world ? probably not . taken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society . maybe it ' s just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience . the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism - only the strong will survive . the marvel of labute ' s multi - layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way . but does the film work as entertainment ? its darned funny in spots , particularly in the men ' s room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions . it works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers . stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her . likewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions . by the end of the film you ' ll feel as if you ' ve met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film . certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed . but the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time . like all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world . while watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn ' t help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs . there may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad - ness to the level of art .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":61}],"source":["import nltk\n","from nltk.corpus import movie_reviews\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","nltk.download('movie_reviews')\n","documents = [(list(movie_reviews.words(fileid)), category)\n","             for category in movie_reviews.categories()\n","             for fileid in movie_reviews.fileids(category)]\n","reviews = [' '.join(doc) for doc, _ in documents]\n","labels = [1 if label == 'pos' else 0 for _, label in documents]\n","df = pd.DataFrame({'text': reviews, 'label': labels})\n","df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":62,"id":"2LxB2ILfgqgm","metadata":{"id":"2LxB2ILfgqgm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1731481789588,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":37636,"user":{"displayName":"UI21CS44_RAHUL KUMAR SINGH","userId":"14745601061033959114"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"cffeff4c-6ff1-4d0a-c5de-84e697ec1eb6"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["             ngram_type  accuracy  precision    recall  f1_score\n","0             Uni-grams  0.810000   0.798701  0.825503  0.811881\n","1        Uni + Bi-grams  0.770000   0.718579  0.882550  0.792169\n","2  Uni + Bi + Tri-grams  0.730000   0.661905  0.932886  0.774373\n","3              Bi-grams  0.821667   0.793846  0.865772  0.828250\n","4             Tri-grams  0.796667   0.773292  0.835570  0.803226\n","5        Bi + Tri-grams  0.808333   0.765217  0.885906  0.821151\n"]}],"source":["X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df['text'], df['label'], test_size=0.3, random_state=42)\n","results = []\n","results.append(evaluate_model((1, 1), 'Uni-grams'))\n","results.append(evaluate_model((1, 2), 'Uni + Bi-grams'))\n","results.append(evaluate_model((1, 3), 'Uni + Bi + Tri-grams'))\n","results.append(evaluate_model((2, 2), 'Bi-grams'))\n","results.append(evaluate_model((3, 3), 'Tri-grams'))\n","results.append(evaluate_model((2, 3), 'Bi + Tri-grams'))\n","results_df = pd.DataFrame(results)\n","print(results_df)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":63,"id":"vPrRtxVyhJBk","metadata":{"id":"vPrRtxVyhJBk","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1731481833329,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":43743,"user":{"displayName":"UI21CS44_RAHUL KUMAR SINGH","userId":"14745601061033959114"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"6f1c221e-73e4-46a0-c339-11f8d0491c5e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package reuters to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package twitter_samples to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping corpora/twitter_samples.zip.\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package product_reviews_1 to\n","[nltk_data]     /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping corpora/product_reviews_1.zip.\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package names to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping corpora/names.zip.\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package webtext to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping corpora/webtext.zip.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Evaluating on Movie Reviews dataset...\n","                                                text  label\n","0  plot : two teen couples go to a church party ,...      0\n","1  the happy bastard ' s quick movie review damn ...      0\n","2  it is movies like these that make a jaded movi...      0\n","3  \" quest for camelot \" is warner bros .
